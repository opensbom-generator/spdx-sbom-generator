# Contributing to the Project
Everyone is encouraged to participate in the SPDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generator project. Anyone can influence the project by simply being involved in the discussions about new features, the roadmap, architecture, and even problems they are facing.

Community meetings are held every Wednesday, 11:00am-12:00pm Pacific (2:00pm-3:00pm EDT, 6:00pm-7:00pm UTC), online. Join the meeting [here](https://meet.jit.si/SBOM-tools)

This is the process we suggest for contributions. This process is designed to reduce the burden on project reviews, impact on other contributors, and to keep the amount of rework from the contributor to a minimum.

1. [Create a Fork of spdx-sbom-generator](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-sbom-generator) to your personal GitHub account by clicking the fork button on the top right corner of the spdx-sbom-genrator project repo page in GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine. For details, see [Creating a Fork](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962#creating-a-fork).
3. On your development computer, navigate to the ***spdx-sbom-generator*** folder that was created when you cloned the project.

4. Rename the default remote pointing to the upstream repository from origin to upstream:
    ```
    git remote rename origin upstream
    ```
    Ensure that you let Git know about the fork you just created, naming it origin:

    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your github id>/spdx-sbom-generator
    ```
    and verify the remote repos:

    ```
    git remote -v
    ```
    The output should look similar to:
    
```
    origin   https://github.com/<your github id>/spdx-sbom-generator (fetch)
    origin   https://github.com/<your github id>/spdx-sbom-generator (push)
    upstream https://github.com/spdx/spdx-sbom-generator (fetch)
    upstream https://github.com/spdx/spdx-sbom-generator (push)
```
5. create a branch (off of main) for your work. If youâ€™re addressing an issue, we suggest you to include the issue type as the branch name, for example:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b fix_typo
    ```
4. Make changes to the project.
5. When things look good, start the pull request process by adding your changed files:

    ```
    git add [file(s) that changed, add -p if you want to be more specific]
    ```
    You can see files that are not yet staged using:

    ```
    git status
    ```
6. Commit your changes to your local repo:

 ```
 git commit -s
 ```
 The ```-s``` option automatically adds your ```Signed-off-by:``` to your commit message. Your commit will be rejected without this line.
    
 Adding ```Sign-off-by``` while commiting changes indicates your agreement with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/), a copy of which is included below.

7. Push your topic branch with your changes to your forked personal GitHub account:
    ```
    git push origin <branch name>
    ```
7. In your web browser, go to your forked repo and click on the ```Compare & pull request``` button for the branch you just worked on that you want to open a pull request with.
8. Review the pull request changes, and verify that you are opening a pull request for the appropriate branch. The title and message from your commit message should appear as well.
9. Click on the submit button and your pull request is sent and awaits review. Email will be sent as review comments are made, or you can check on your pull request at https://github.com/spdx/spdx-sbom-generator/pulls.
